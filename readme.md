Q2:
Describe the visualization and how it is similar and/or different from yours. Is it easy to interpret? Does it
effectively visualize what is being asked? Why or why not?

It's different. It's easy to interpret. It effectively visualize, since it uses dynamic visualization instead of my static one. Also, It used a world map to render the data.

Q3:

It's similar. It's easy to interpret. 
That is because, it not only shows relationship between GDP etc. and time for each continent, but also shows relationship between correlation s and time for each continent.

Q4:
See codes and plot and model coefficient in jupyter notebook's respective section.
Justify your choice of model and comment on its appropriateness:

used a second-order poly model. It somewhat describes the trend, but autocorrelation has negative impact on quality of modelling here.

Generally, the pearson coefficient between income and life
expectancy increases with time. And it increase more and more rapidlly, formally with greater derivative.

Q5:
See codes and plot and model coefficient in jupyter notebook's respective section.
Justify your choice of model and comment on its appropriateness:

used a second-order poly model. It cannot describes the scatter very well , since autocorrelation has a huge negative impact on quality of modelling here.

Generally, the pearson coefficient between income and child mortality decreases with time. It's almost linear here, so maybe a linear model is enough here.
